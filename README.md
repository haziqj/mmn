## Aim

To publish a write-up of both the statistical methods and findings of the following research questions:

1. Has there been a change in "mood" in parliament after the recent economic downturn and drop in oil prices?
2. What is the evolution of topics debated year-on-year, and do they reflect the public opinion on the matter? Hot topics in recent years: scholarships availability, brain drain, unemployment, food prices, shariah law implementation.
3. ...

## Things to do

1. Data retrieval (automatically, if possible) and cleanup. Speeches would contain names and titles of members, such as "Pehin Orang Kaya ..." which contributes nothing contextually.
2. Bag-of-words model is simplest. Frequency of words would be interesting.
3. Sentiment analysis?
